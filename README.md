# More Practice With Basic MVC

This practical provide further practice using the ideas we looked at last week; moving from flat PHP files to an MVC structure. This time we will look at a user authentication example. 

* Put the PHP files on a web server. You should recognise this example, it is the simple user authentication example we looked at in term 1. 

* Create a file called *auth-fns.php*. This file will contain a series of functions to help with authentication tasks
